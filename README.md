# CSS_WebVisualization

A visualization dashboard website is created for the "API World Weather" project. 
https://tinahuangyt.github.io/CSS_WebVisualization/maxtemp.html

In building this dashboard, individual pages were created for each plot and a means by which users can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page is also included, where users can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where users can view the raw data used to build the plots.

In constructing the website, a number of tools were used:
- Bootstrap navbar component for the header on each page.
- Bootstrap table compotent for the data page.
- Bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page.
- CSS media query for the navigation menu to ensure the website works at all window widths.
